Design Notes / To do

- How to handle outgoing packets? Have functions add to queue and have a wrapper function to actually call send?
  -> have to put a timer between packets?  can't use sleep cause it LDs the game.  Possible just to spam a whole inventory of packets though.

- Auto accept group invites
- Move to location x,y



- Lock to gaheris and pendragon
